### **This MD file was for my Year 11 Digitech Class. The reason why I chose Digitech this year is because I think it is an important skill to learn for the long term future.**

### **About Me**
I enjoy racing *(online because I cannot drive legally)* on games like **Assetto Corsa** and **Forza Horizon 5**. I absolutely love cars and especially the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut and Porsche 911 GT3RS! My enjoyement for cars led me to pursue Mechanical Engineering.

### **Aspirations**

I would like to become a Mechanical Engineer working on cars. If I am not stressed out, I would continue to become an Aeronautic Engineer instead. If all goes to fail, I will become a professional Musician and play in Classical Concerts instead!
